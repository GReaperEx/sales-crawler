# sales-crawler
Saves vital info about the sales users of supported websites offer, in a sqlite database.

I'd suggest altering the "delay" values if you don't want to stress the target server.

Supported websites up to date:
* insomnia.gr
* aggeliopolis.gr
* freelist.gr

Note that some parsers need to disguise themselves as some common browser such as firefox to avoid being rejected.
